Coderbyte-Solutions
===================

After finishing all of Coderbyte's easy difficulty challenges (and starting on the medium), I thought it might be useful for both myself (and anyone else learning javascript by completing these challenges) to go back through each challenge with cleaner/well-commented code.

Note that I'm still in the process of uploading each solution, and will clean up/comment everything once I'm finished.
