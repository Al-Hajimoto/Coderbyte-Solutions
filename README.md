Coderbyte-Solutions
===================

After finishing all of Coderbyte's easy and medium challenges, I thought it might be useful for both myself (and anyone else learning javascript by completing these challenges) to go back through each challenge with cleaner/well-commented code. Note that this repo is aimed at allowing novice programmers the ability to follow along and are by no means the most optimized/best solutions.

#### Feel free to contribute your own solutions or improve upon the ones I've created!
* In order to contribute to this repo, you should start out by forking a copy of it to your own github account and then clone down your fork to your computer so you can work on it locally.
* Once you've added or modified your solution:
* Add your modified files with `git add [filePath]` and then use `git commit` to save your changes to your local repo (making sure to have a concise, informative commit message).
* Next, you'll need to `git push origin master` so that your fork of the repo will recieve your new code.
* Finally, create a pull request to the master repo (be sure to include  a concise, informative comment on your pull!) and I'll either merge it right away or give you feedback on how you can improve your solution!
